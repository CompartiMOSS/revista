Being able to execute multiple instances of Microsoft Teams is a long-waited feature that is affecting negatively all the users that belong to multiple organizations. If you are doing multiple tenant swaps during the day to keep up with everything that is happening in all your organizations this article is for you, even though Microsoft Teams does not support multiple instances you will be able to execute the web version as standalone app and you will be able to be signed in in all the organizations ate the same time.

In order to accomplish the steps described in this article you will need to install Node.js, instructions and the installation packages can be found [here](https&#58;//nodejs.org/en/download/).

Once Node.js is installed in your system open the command line and execute the command below.

npm install -g nativefier
