    Microsoft MVP Azure | Technical Manager & Azure Evangelist en everis NTT Data 
    <br /><br />
    I dedicated my time to the marvellous Cloud world technologies world, while I have the opportunity to speak and expose more people to new services and technologies that Cloud could offer. I have more than 10 years of experience in the IT world. Mostly related with Microsoft Azure & .NET technologies and their services. I have participated in mobile applications developments, also with real time communication and control systems projects. In addition, I have made web developments in different languages and work systems.
    <br /><br />
    My main challenge as Evangelist and Technical Manager in everis, NTT Data is to give the best of myself everytime i assist in a project where I’m necessary. Getting ahead projects to big companies, working hand by hand with my teammates. My other big challenge is being able to communicate my work, using meetups, events and congresses to do so. While I’m speaking about new technical and technological developments that arise on the Microsoft Azure Platform. A fundamental step that also helps me to reinforce my career is being an active member of the .NET community and being recognised by Microsoft as an Azure MVP.
