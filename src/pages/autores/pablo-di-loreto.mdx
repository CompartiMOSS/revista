    Professor. Techie. Ice cream fan (dulce de leche). My favorite phrase: "Todos los días pueden no ser buenos ... pero hay algo bueno en todos los días".

    I am from Berazategui City, Buenos Aires, Argentina [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partido_de_Berazategui]. When I was 16 years old, I started learning how to manage servers and create software with (very very old) several technologies. I am a Systems Analyst and Physical Education Teacher. I enjoy educational & technological talks and a good beer. If you want to talk with me, write me to pablodiloreto@hotmail.com or visit my website at https://pablodiloreto.com/.
